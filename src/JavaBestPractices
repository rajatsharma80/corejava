- Double is recommended over float as computer processes double faster than float.
 Secondly, there are certain MATH libraries that uses Double.
- Even when if(){ } block is having 1 statement, use the { } as it makes the code clean and less error prone
- Return -1 for calculations where we want to return value not found or error.
- It is good practice to use Method overloading when similar operation with different arguments needs to be performed.
- Method overloading helps in readability, consistency in naming i.e. one name for method commonly used.
Example: System.out.println()

- As a general practise, when defining a variable in Java class we define it as Private.
- It is a best practice to setup constructor(default values) values using this keyword instead of setter method.
Example:

public class Bank{
String a;
int b;
    public Bank(){}

    public class Bank(String a, int b){
        this.a = a;     //instead of using setA("")
        this.b = b;     //instead of using setB(0)
    }
}

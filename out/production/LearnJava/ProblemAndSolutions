Problem 1: - Problem while taking user inputs.
When user enters an integers first and then tries to enter String, control exits without taking String input.
Reason: When user enters numbers in the integer variable and press enter, \n is stored in the buffer. Which String
variable reads and considers it is exited.
Solution:
write another line scanner.nextLine() before
           taking the next input otherwise control will exit without taking the next input..

Problem 2: When a double value is printed with a long length of decimal.
Solution: This can be handled by formatting the double number. First convert it to a string and then format it as below:

         String.format("%.2f", 20.000001) This will format 20.000001 to 20.00.

Problem 3: One cannot predict user input, say a variable is expecting integer and user is entering string, It will
through numberFormat exception.
Solution:  Use scanner.hasNextInt()
